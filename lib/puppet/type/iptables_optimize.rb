      Instead of matching rule counts, perform a more precise match against the
      running and to-be-applied rules. You may find that minor changes, such as
      a simple netmask change will not be enforced without enabling this option.

      This is enabled by default because it is a more correct approach.

      * NOTE: You **MUST** use the exact same syntax that will be returned by
        `iptables-save` if you enable this option!
      * For example, you cannot write `echo-request` for an ICMP echo match, you
        must instead use `8`.

  newparam(:ignore) do
    desc <<-EOM
      Ignore all *running* iptables rules matching one or more provided Ruby
      regexes. The regexes are compared against the jump and chain options, as
      well as the interface name of the running rules and excluded from the
      synchronization comparison against the new rules.

      !!Do not include the beginning and ending slashes in your regular expressions.!!

      NOTE: If a rule has been added or removed, this setting ignored and
      iptables *will* be restarted! If you have services which are
      affected by this, make sure that they subscribe to
      Service['iptables'] and/or Service['ip6tables'] as appropriate.

      Examples:
        # Preserve all rules whose jump or chain begins with the word 'foo'
        ignore => '^foo'

        # Preserve all rules whose jump or chain begins with the word 'foo' or
        # ends with the word 'bar'
        ignore => ['^foo','bar$']
