      Ignore all *running* ip6tables rules matching one or more
      provided Ruby regexes. The regexes are compared against the
      running rules and excluded from the synchronization comparison
      against the new rules. Do not include the beginning and ending
      slashes in your regular expressions.

      NOTE: If a rule has been added or removed, this setting ignored and
      ip6tables *will* be restarted! If you have services which are
      affected by this, make sure that they subscribe to
      Service['ip6tables'] and/or Service['ip6tables'] as appropriate.

      Examples:
        # Preserve all rules whose chain begins with the word 'foo'
        ignore => '^foo'

        # Preserve all rules whose chain begins with the word 'foo' or
        # ends with the word 'bar'
        ignore => ['^foo','bar$']
