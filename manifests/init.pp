# Add management of iptables with default rule optimization and a failsafe
# fallback mode
#
# This class will detect conflicts with the SIMP option
# ``simp_options::firewall`` and, if necessary, cease management of IPTables in
# the case of a conflict.
#
# In particular, this means that if ``simp_options::firewall`` is ``false``,
# but you have included this class, it will refuse to manage IPTables and will
# instead raise a warning.
#
# If the ``simp_options::firewall`` variable is not present, the module will
# manage IPTables as expected.
#
# @param enable
#   Enable IPTables
#
#   * If set to ``false`` will **disable** IPTables completely
#   * If set to ``ignore`` will stop managing IPTables
#
# @param ensure
#   The state that the ``package`` resources should target
#
#   * May take any value acceptable to the native ``package`` resource
#     ``ensure`` parameter
#
# @param ipv6
#   Also manage IP6Tables
#
# @param class_debug
#   Print messages regarding rule comparisons
#
# @param optimize_rules
#   Run the inbuilt iptables rule optimizer to collapse the rules down to as
#   small as is reasonably possible without reordering
#
#   * IPsets will be eventually be incorporated
#
# @param ignore
#   Regular expressions that you would like to match in order to preserve
#   running rules
#
#   * This modifies the behavior of the ``iptables_optimize`` Type.
#   * Do **not** include the beginning and ending ``/`` but **do** include an
#     end or beginning of word marker (``^`` and/or ``$``) if appropriate
#
# @param default_rules
#   Enable the usual set of default deny rules that you would expect to see on
#   most systems
#
#   * Uses the following expectations of rule ordering (not enforced):
#       * 1     -> ``ESTABLISHED`` and ``RELATED`` rules
#       * 2-5   -> Standard ``ACCEPT`` and ``DENY`` rules
#       * 6-10  -> ``JUMP`` to other rule sets
#       * 11-20 -> Pure ``ACCEPT`` rules
#       * 22-30 -> ``LOG`` and ``REJECT`` rules
#
# @param scanblock
#   Enable a technique for setting up port-based triggers that will block
#   anyone connecting to the system for an hour after connection to a forbidden
#   port
#
# @param prevent_localhost_spoofing
#   Add rules to ``PREROUTING`` that will prevent spoofed packets from
#   ``localhost`` addresses from reaching your system
